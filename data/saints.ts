    story: `# St. Francis of Assisi

**Born:** 1181  
**Died:** October 3, 1226  
**Canonized:** July 16, 1228

## Early Life

Born Giovanni di Pietro di Bernardone in Assisi, Italy, Francis was the son of a wealthy cloth merchant. In his youth, he lived a carefree life and dreamed of becoming a knight.

## Conversion

After experiencing visions and a profound spiritual awakening, Francis renounced his wealthy lifestyle. He famously stripped naked in the town square, returning his clothes to his father, and dedicated his life to serving God and the poor.

## Founding the Franciscans

Francis gathered followers who shared his vision of living in poverty and serving others. In 1209, Pope Innocent III approved his simple rule, and the Franciscan order was born.

## Love for Creation

St. Francis had a deep love for all of God's creation. He preached to birds, tamed a wolf, and saw all creatures as his brothers and sisters. This earned him the title of patron saint of animals and the environment.

## The Stigmata

In 1224, while praying on Mount La Verna, Francis received the stigmata - the wounds of Christ appeared on his hands, feet, and side. He was the first recorded person to receive this mystical gift.

## Legacy

St. Francis revolutionized Christian spirituality with his emphasis on poverty, humility, and care for creation. His influence extends far beyond the Catholic Church, inspiring people of all faiths to live more simply and compassionately.

*"Lord, make me an instrument of your peace."* - Prayer of St. Francis`

    story: `# St. Joan of Arc

**Born:** c. 1412  
**Died:** May 30, 1431  
**Canonized:** May 16, 1920

## Early Life

Joan was born in DomrÃ©my, France, during the Hundred Years' War. She was a peasant girl who grew up in a time when France was largely occupied by English forces.

## Divine Visions

At age 13, Joan began experiencing visions of Saints Michael, Margaret, and Catherine, who told her to drive out the English and bring the Dauphin (later Charles VII) to Reims for his coronation.

## Military Leadership

Despite her youth and humble origins, Joan convinced the court of her divine mission. She was given armor and troops, and led several military campaigns that turned the tide of the war in France's favor.

## Capture and Trial

In 1430, Joan was captured by Burgundian allies of the English. She was put on trial for heresy and witchcraft by an ecclesiastical court. Despite her eloquent defense, she was condemned and burned at the stake at age 19.

## Vindication and Canonization

Twenty-five years after her death, a retrial declared her innocent. She became a symbol of French nationalism and was canonized in 1920, becoming the patron saint of France.

## Legacy

St. Joan of Arc remains one of history's most remarkable figures - a teenage girl who changed the course of history through her unwavering faith and courage. She inspires people to stand up for their convictions, even in the face of overwhelming opposition.

*"I am not afraid... I was born to do this."* - St. Joan of Arc`
